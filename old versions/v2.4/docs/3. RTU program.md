### RTU program

The block bellow is part of the library that link the physical hardware to the queries for one particular rtu-bus.

```pascal
#mb_master_ctrl(hardware_id := "Local~CB_1241_(RS485)", 
                operating_mode := 4, // 4 => RS-485 (Only mb_master_1500_ctrl)
                baud := 19200,  
                timeout := T#0ms, // 0 => auto
                error => _bool_out_ ,
                mb_query := #mb_query );
                
#mb_query(...);
#mb_query(...);
...
```

- There should be one "mb_master_xxxx_ctrl" for one rtu bus. 
- All queries bellonging to one "ctrl" need to be called in the same order at each plc scan. This implies they need to be called from the same OB.
- Even parity is default, according to the modbus specification. If for some reason this need to be change it can be done with: #mb_master_ctrl.conf.parity
- Timeout is calculated automatically according to the baud rate, but not according to telegram length and the number of repeaters.
- hardware_id, the id for one RS-485 or RS-232 module.
- If the library is imported in to a S7-1500 PLC, the mb_master_1200_ctrl block generate a lot of errors, delete the block to get rid of them.
- If the mb_master_1500_ctrl is used, then remember set the operation_mode input parameter: 0=>RS-232 ; 1-3=>RS-422 ; 4=>RS-485 (default)

#### Advanced parameters:   
- #mb_master_ctrl.comm_load.FLOW_CTRL   
- #mb_master_ctrl.comm_load.RTS_OFF_DLY
- #mb_master_ctrl.comm_load.RTS_ON_DLY
- #mb_master_ctrl.comm_load.ICHAR_GAP
- #mb_master_ctrl.master.Blocked_Proc_Timeout
- #mb_master_ctrl.master.EXTENDED_ADDRESSING
- #mb_master_ctrl.master.BLOCKED_PROC_TIMEOUT
- #mb_master_ctrl.conf.retries
- #mb_master_ctrl.conf.parity

#### Same memory

There are two blocks for modbus rtu, one S7-1200 and one other for S7-1500, delete the one that is not used. Also if the library is only used for rtu then all blocks related to tcp can be removed to save memory.

- mb_master_1200_ctrl OR mb_master_1500_ctrl 
- mb_client_ctrl
- mb_delay
- mb_delay_between_queries
