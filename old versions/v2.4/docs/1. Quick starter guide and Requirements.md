## Quick starter guide

 - Download the latest release: https://github.com/rexhip/rexhip/releases
 - Start a new project in TIA-portal, and then add new PLC, a S7-1200 or a S7-1500.
 - Localise "External Source files" in the tree structure on the left and import the files inside the lib-folder of the downloaded zip-file.
 - Select the imported files, right click them and choose "Generate blocks from source". If a S7-1500 is chosen, then there will be lot of errors becouse there isn't any support for mb_master_1200_ctrl, delete the block to solve the errors. 
 - Open the "Station_block" folder and see if there alleredy exist a SB for your device, if not study the start examples and customize the code for the modbus device.
 - Other blocks that are not needed can also be deleted, to save memory.
